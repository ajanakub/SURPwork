# This is the code used for the project I undertook with the Roussos Lab at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mt Sinai for Dr. Panos Roussos with the help of my mentor, Dr. Kiran Girdhar. 
# This project leveraged DNA methylation and ATAC-seq data to recreate the 3-dimensional architecture of DNA to uncover information regarding the  eitopathogenesis of different psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.
